# Logic Errors

This project demonstrates fixing Python code that runs but gives incorrect output.  
It contains a file with broken logic (`broken_code.py`) and the corrected version (`fixed_code.py`).  

## Skills Highlighted
- Debugging logical errors
- Correcting loops and conditional statements
- Understanding algorithm flow

## How to Use
1. Run `broken_code.py` → Observe incorrect outputs.  
2. Run `fixed_code.py` → Correct outputs appear.
