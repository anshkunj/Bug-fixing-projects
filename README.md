# Python Bug Fixing & Debugging Portfolio

This repository showcases practical Python debugging and bug-fixing skills through a series of structured projects.  
It is designed to demonstrate the ability to identify, analyze, and correct broken code in real-world scenarios, making it ideal for clients, recruiters, or anyone seeking Python development expertise.

---

## 🧰 Skills Demonstrated
- Debugging syntax and logical errors
- Fixing runtime exceptions and errors
- Exception handling with try/except
- Algorithm debugging (loops, recursion, sorting/searching)
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable Python code
- Problem-solving and analytical thinking

---

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 01. Syntax Errors
Fixes missing colons, parentheses, and indentation issues.  
**Skills:** Python syntax, debugging, attention to detail

### 02. Logic Errors
Corrects code that runs but produces incorrect outputs.  
**Skills:** Loop and condition debugging, arithmetic corrections, logic analysis

### 03. Runtime Errors
Handles exceptions that cause programs to crash.  
**Skills:** ZeroDivisionError, KeyError, TypeError, IndexError

### 04. Exception Handling
Adds robust error handling to make code fail-safe.  
**Skills:** try/except, safe file operations, input validation

### 05. Algorithm Debugging
Fixes broken algorithms like recursion, factorial, Fibonacci, and sorting logic.  
**Skills:** Loops, recursion, sorting/searching logic, algorithmic thinking
