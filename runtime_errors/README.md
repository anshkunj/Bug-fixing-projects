# Runtime Errors

This project demonstrates fixing Python code that throws runtime errors during execution.  
It contains a file with broken code (`broken_code.py`) and the corrected version (`fixed_code.py`).  

## Skills Highlighted
- Debugging runtime errors
- Exception handling
- Tracing execution flow

## How to Use
1. Run `broken_code.py` → Observe errors like ZeroDivisionError, KeyError, TypeError.  
2. Run `fixed_code.py` → Corrected code executes without errors.
