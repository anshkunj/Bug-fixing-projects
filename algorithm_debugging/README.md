# Algorithm Debugging

This project demonstrates fixing Python algorithms that produce incorrect results.  
It contains a file with broken code (`broken_code.py`) and the corrected version (`fixed_code.py`).  

## Skills Highlighted
- Debugging algorithms
- Fixing recursive and iterative logic
- Correcting sorting/searching mistakes

## How to Use
1. Run `broken_code.py` → Observe incorrect results.  
2. Run `fixed_code.py` → Corrected outputs are produced.
